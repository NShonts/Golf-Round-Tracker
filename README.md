# Golf-Round-Tracker

Golf Round Tracker is an application built using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 

Here is a link to the active site: [Golf Round Tracker](https://nshonts.github.io/Golf-Round-Tracker/)

The main functionality is to use local storage to keep track of golf rounds played. 

This project was completed based on Brad Traversy's Vanilla Javascript Booklist tutorial.
